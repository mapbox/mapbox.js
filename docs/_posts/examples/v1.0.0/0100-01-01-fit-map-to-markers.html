<div id='map'></div>
<script>
var map = L.mapbox.map('map')
    .setView([38, -102.0], 9)
    .addLayer(L.mapbox.styleLayer('mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v11'));

// As with any other AJAX request, this technique is subject to the Same Origin Policy:
// http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy
// So the CSV file must be on the same domain as the Javascript, or the server
// delivering it should support CORS.
var featureLayer = L.mapbox.featureLayer()
    .loadURL('{{site.baseurl}}/assets/data/eastcoast_cities.geojson')
    .addTo(map);

// Especially with dynamic data, it's useful to automatically fit all markers
// in the map bounds instead of guessing and checking center and zoom values

// Since this layer is loaded with the asynchronous method loadURL, that uses
// AJAX in the background, we wait for all of the markers to be loaded by
// waiting for the ready event. If you don't load your markers with an async
// method and instead set them with setGeoJSON or similar, you don't need
// to do this.
featureLayer.on('ready', function() {
    // featureLayer.getBounds() returns the corners of the furthest-out markers,
    // and map.fitBounds() makes sure that the map contains these.
    map.fitBounds(featureLayer.getBounds());
});
