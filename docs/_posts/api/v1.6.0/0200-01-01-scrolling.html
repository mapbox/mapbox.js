<h2 id="section-scrolling">Scrolling</h2>
<p>If you&#39;re planning on having a page that has large amounts of scrolling,
try to avoid a large map height. Having a &#39;tall&#39; map can cause the user
to get stuck on the map while scrolling. Another way around this is to disable
<code>dragging</code> for mobile devices: <code>map.dragging.disable();</code></p>
