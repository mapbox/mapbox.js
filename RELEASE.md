# Creating a release of mapbox.js

The majority of the release process is done on a release branch. Once all the artifacts are built and published, you will need to get your release reviewed and approved. Once approved the release branch is ready to be merged into the default `publisher-production` branch. After being merged the release can be tagged and Github release created.

Checklist:
- [ ] Make sure the changelog has been updated
- [ ] Do the release (part 1) in a release branch (using manual or automated process below)
- [ ] Create release PR and get it reviewed and approved
- [ ] Merge release branch into `publisher-production`
- [ ] Finalize the release (part 2)
