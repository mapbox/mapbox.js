# Examples

Examples are added in the `gh-pages` branch. Create a new file in the
[_posts/examples/v1.0.0](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox.js/tree/gh-pages/_posts/examples/v1.0.0) path.
All examples have the fake post date `0100-01-01`. Look at surrounding examples and follow the same style -
`HTML` that is templated into a page, and does not include surrounding cruft. Add `tags` to the YAML header
to categorize your new example.

* Try to keep external dependencies to a minimum
* All new external dependencies must be HTTPS / SSL-safe

## Code Style

* [Same as Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
* Use comments extensively
* Use descriptive, informative variable names.
