The MapBox Javascript API makes
building web maps faster, simpler, and more repeatable.
With it, you can make anything
from a [one-line simple setup](/mapbox.js/example/auto/) to animated,
dynamic, integrated maps.

The [map object](/mapbox.js/api/#mapbox.map) is the core of the API -
a fast, cross-browser viewer that can turn any element on your website
into a map. It's based on [Modest Maps](http://modestmaps.com/), a library
with years of development and testing.

On top of your maps, the API supports [user interface elements](/mapbox.js/api/#User_interface)
that make it easy to add zoom controls, attribution, legends and more. It's
made to be designer-friendly, with full control in CSS and beautiful,
well-shaped styles by default.

MapBox's [markers library](/mapbox.js/api/#mapbox.markers.layer) lets you add
dynamic data to maps - from [MapBox markers](http://mapbox.com/tour/design/),
Javascript functions, or external datasources. Those markers can be fully
customized with styles and custom events and behaviors.

Maps support [easing](/mapbox.js/api/#Easing) - smooth transitions from
one location or zoom level to another. This makes it possible to use
timelines and links to move the map without losing a sense of distance
and spatial relationships.
